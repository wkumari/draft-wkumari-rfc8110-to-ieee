Abstract

   RFC8110 describes Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), a mode
   that allows unauthenticated clients to connect to a network using
   encrypted traffic.  This document transfers the ongoing maintenance
   and further development of the protocol to the IEEE 802.11 Working
   Group.

   This document updates RFC8110 by noting that future work on the
   protocol described in RFC8110 will occur in the IEEE 802.11 Working
   Group.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8110] describes Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), a mode
   of opportunistic security [RFC7435] for IEEE Std 802.11 that provides
   encryption of the wireless medium without authentication.

   Since publication, [RFC8110] (also known as "[Wi-Fi_Enhanced_Open]")
   has been widely implemented and deployed.

   [IEEE_802.11] has requested [IEEE_LS] that in order to allow for
   ongoing maintenance and further development of the protocol, and to
   ensure that the protocol remains in sync with the IEEE protocols,
   future work on the protocol described in RFC8110 will now occur in
   [IEEE_802.11].  This document is a concurrence.

2.  Transfer of Maintenance

   At the request of [IEEE_802.11], in order to allow for ongoing
   maintenance and further development of the protocol, and to ensure
   that the protocol remains in sync with the IEEE protocols, this
   document specifies that future work on the protocol described in
   RFC8110 will now occur in [IEEE_802.11].

   The protocol defined in RFC8110 will be duplicated in [IEEE_802.11]
   such that that document alone will be enough to implement it and any
   further maintenance or modification of the protocol will be performed
   in IEEE under its policies and procedures.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document simply notes that future work on the protocol described
   in RFC8110 will now occur in the IEEE.  As such, it does not
   introduce any new security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank the IEEE 802.11 working group for
   their work, and for taking on the responsibility for future work on
   the protocol described in RFC8110.

   In addition, we would like to thank Stephen Farrell, who AD sponsored
   the original work, as well as Clemens Schimpe, Dorothy Stanley, Paul
   Wouters, Eric Vyncke, Mike Montemurro, and Peter Yee.

   Apologies to anyone we forgot to acknowledge; RFC8110 was written 7+
   years ago and we have had many conversations with many people since
   then...

Change Log

   *  From -00 to -01:

      -  Fixed a nit ("This documents updates" -> "This document
         updates")

   *  From -01 to -02:

      -  We have the liaison from the IEEE 802.11 WG; update to point at
         the liaison statement.
